/*
  App.css — intentionally minimal.
  All layout, component, and responsive styles live in global.css.
  This file only exists for any App-level overrides if needed in future.

  IMPORTANT: Do NOT redefine .navbar, .steps-content-wrapper, .phone-container,
  .hero-section, .benefits-grid, .pledge-grid, or any section classes here.
  Those are all owned by global.css and duplicating them causes cascade conflicts
  that break the layout (the Steps phone float bug was caused by this).
